# flutter_feature_flags

Feature flags for flutter apps , based on [codeminers feature toggles](https://github.com/Code-Miners/CoreModules-FeatureToggles)

Currently this is very basic and was created as a learning exercise, i'll flesh it out if I need to acutally use it! 

The configuration can be a url or a location of a json file, see example dart file for details
